#A taste of TPL's Javascript Roots

##Introduction
In my first tutorial [Introduction to the Tool Path Language (TPL)](https://github.com/DougCoffland/buildbotics-ui/blob/master/learn/tplang_1.md), I gave a very brief introduction and showed how to cut a very simple shape.  In the end we noticed that very little was gained by using TPL over [g-code](http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code).

In this tutorial, you will begin to see how TPL's Javascript roots change everything.

As a side note, I've known many people that draw the line at "writing code" and simply refuse to do it.  Even if you are one of those people, I ask that you read along.  Javascript and TPL programs are extremely easy to write, and you may find that you actually like it.

Open up a text editor and create a new file called tpl_tpl2.tpl.
Save the file in a folder that is convenient for training.
Configure the editor for Javascript language if it has that capability.
