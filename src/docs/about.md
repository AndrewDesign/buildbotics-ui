# About Buildbotics

## Vision

Buildbotics enables small scale manufacturers and designers of all skill levels to get the most out of their skills and equipment.  We will be the place people go to show off their projects, to get projects that they can build themselves, to learn new and better ways of designing and building things, and to share their experiences with others for the betterment of the manufacturing community.

## Mission

Provide a web site that enables sharing of project designs and sharing of information within the small scale manufacturing community.  Our web site will grow and improve based on user feedback and needs.  The web site will be:
* a place where users can easily share their projects with others.
* a place where users can get access to information that fits their skill level and satisfies their desires to build and create new things.
* a place where its users can help one-another learn how to solve their small-scale manufacturing problems.

## The Company

Buildbotics LLC is a California-based Limited Liability Corporation that was founded by Joseph Coffland and Doug Coffland (yes, we're related) in 2014.  Joe is President and Doug is Vice-Presicent.  At present, Joe and Doug are the only employees of Buildbotics LLC.  It has been a labor of love and neither Joe nor Doug currently receive a salary for their efforts.

While BuildBotics.com is currently a small startup company, we have significant capabilities and a vast amount of related experience. This includes:
* Joe is the inventor of the [OpenSCAM](www.openscam.org) (previously known as OpenSCAM) simulation tool that allows users to see what will be built before they send their “GCode” to the machine. This single, and unique capability saves countless hours of effort and material that is often lost by sending designs to machines that are incorrect.
* Joe has also developed all-new computer language called [Tool Path Language](www.tplang.org) (TPL).   TPL is based on javascript.  It's easy to learn and enables the design of things without the use of general Computer Aided Design software.
* Joe has worked as a web developer and software consultant for many years and is also the president of Cauldron Development LLC, which does software consulting and web design.
* Doug Coffland ran a successful electronics company (Savant Electronics) dedicated to collecting and processing telephone call detail records.  Doug designed the hardware and software for that business.
* Until recently, Doug was employed by a National Laboratory directly managing approximately 100 scientists, engineers, and technicians.
* Doug and Joseph are both degreed engineers with over 50 years of combined experience.
