# About Buildbotics

## Mission
Our main goal is to make desktop manufacturing easier.  CNC, 3D printers and LASER cutters are awesome tools but using them can be both expensive and challenging.  Fortunately, many companies are beginning to produce relative cheap machines but the software to run them effectively is both costly and difficult to use.  We believe desktop manufacturing is for everyone.

Buildbotics.com, [OpenSCAM](http://openscam.org/) and [TPL](http://tplang.org) are our answers to these problems.  We still have a long way to go but we are looking forward to working with and helping to expand this vibrant community.
